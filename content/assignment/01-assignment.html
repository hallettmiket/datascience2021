<p>Please note that due dates can be found in the <a href="/Syllabus">Syllabus</a>; submission instructions can be found on the <a href="/Assignments">Assignment Instructions</a> page. In this assignment, you can submit a Google Doc (or other text editor, pictures, etc.) but also your <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span> code via Google Drive.
Samira will go over the submission process in the lab.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({\bf 60}\)</span> total marks.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1 [7 points]</strong> You obtained a <span class="math inline">\({\tt gmail}\)</span> account for this course. With this account, you can also initiate your Google Drive workspace. (i) Does Google have the right to look at your emails, documents, drawings or other objects? (ii) Does Google have the right to use this information? What is meta-data? Can it collect meta-data about your information? (iii) How can you turn on or off the geographical tracking mechanism associated with your account? (iv) Are you satisfied with the level of security and user agreement with Google? (Answer in ~10 sentences please.)</p>
<p><strong>Question 2 [10 points]</strong> Given what you read about Google, highlight any differences with Apple Cloud or other Cloud service provider of your choice. Comment overall on what you found.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3 [3 points]</strong> Explain how cloud computing can reduce the overall cost for computers and computation for a small business or research group? If so, how? Make reference to the definitions and components of cloud and traditional computing from the lecture notes. 4 or 5 sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4 [4 points]</strong> Argue for and against each of the following items as a computing device (make references to the 3 fundamental properties of modern computers).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a bacterium</li>
<li>a plant</li>
<li>a squid</li>
<li>a human</li>
<li>an assembly line to make household appliances</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 5 [4 points]</strong>
Create an <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span> script under <span class="math inline">\({\tt File/NewFile}\)</span>.
Write R code to load the <span class="math inline">\({\tt tidyverse}\)</span> library and the <span class="math inline">\({\tt small\_brca}\)</span> dataset.
Note that in the course slides, I load the dataset from my directory specific to my computer.
However, if you look in the R code in the <span class="math inline">\({\tt src}\)</span> on RStudio Cloud (Project 03), you will find the correct path for you.</p>
<p>Make a comment that this is Question 6, Assignment 1 before your code. Find the function in <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span> that reports the date and the version of <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span> that you are using. Put the code in your file.</p>
<p>Save your R code in your <span class="math inline">\({\tt src}\)</span> directory of the project and name the file <span class="math inline">\({\tt lastname\_assignment1.R}\)</span>. Take a screenshot with your file open (top left), the Environment list showing (top right), the code executed in your R session (bottom left), and the contents of the <span class="math inline">\({\tt src}\)</span> folder (bottom right). Congratulations, you are now an R programmer.</p>
<p><strong>For Questions 6-8 below.</strong> Put a comment in your file that states what question you are working on and put your code below it. For any pictures (eg the plot that your code generates) and text, put them into a text document (eg using Google Docs) stating what question you are working on.</p>
<p><strong>Question 6 [5 points]</strong></p>
<p>Recall from the lecture that <span class="math inline">\({\tt HER2}\)</span> is an important protein in some subtypes of breast cancer, and remmeber that <span class="math inline">\({\tt ERBB2}\)</span> is the official name for <span class="math inline">\({\tt HER2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The variable <span class="math inline">\({\tt ERBB2}\)</span> in our tibble corresponds to estimates of the number of transcripts present in each sample (row). This is obtained using RNA-seq technologies as discussed in the lecture.
Clinically, <span class="math inline">\({\tt HER2}\)</span> is not measured using transcriptomics. Typically the
copy number of <span class="math inline">\({\tt HER2}\)</span> is measured at at the DNA level. This is because we believe that
<span class="math inline">\({\tt HER2}\)</span> over-expression at the transcript and protein levels are due to a amplification of the genomic region tha contains <span class="math inline">\({\tt HER2}\)</span>. In the clinic, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Fluorescence-In-Situ-Hybridization">(FISH)</a> is used.</p>
<p>The variable <span class="math inline">\({\tt her2\_fish\_status}\)</span> gives exactly this, although it is not available for many observations (rows/patient samples).</p>
<p>Using ggplot, making the following scatter plot. Put your R code with your answer.</p>
<p><img src="/assignment/01-assignment_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Comment or interpret the graph in 1 or 2 sentences: does it make sense? is it what you expected? are there issues? etc.</p>
<p><strong>Question 7 [5 points]</strong></p>
<p>It is a little bit hard to see the status of <span class="math inline">\({\tt tumor}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\tt her2\_fish\_status}\)</span> in the figure of Question 6 because so many points are bunched up around the origin of the graph.
Using online resources, figure out how to log-transform the both the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis. Log-transformations will be revisited several times but they are very common transformations of gene expresion data. Recreate the scatterplot with the log-transformed data. Show your code and the image it generates. Comment on whether this transformation helped and if it changes your conclusions from Question 6.</p>
<p><strong>Question 8 [7 points]</strong></p>
<p>Create a boxplot in <span class="math inline">\({\tt ggplot}\)</span> as below. Hint: I logged transformed the expresion of <span class="math inline">\({\tt ERBB2}\)</span>). Comparing positive and negative samples, is there any hypotheses you could form?</p>
<p><img src="/assignment/01-assignment_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><strong>Question 9 [5 points]</strong></p>
<p>The expression of <span class="math inline">\({\tt GRB7}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\tt ERBB2}\)</span> are highly correlated. We will revisit the concept of correlation later in the course, but for now you can see a (positive) linear relationship between the two. Using <span class="math inline">\({\tt PubMed}\)</span> or other resources, can you hypothesize why these two genes have such high correlation in their expression (what is the biological reason that their expression is correlated)?</p>
<p><strong>Question 10 [10 point]</strong>
Suppose there are three friends who are discussing the possibilty of going on
vacation together.
We can call these individuals <span class="math inline">\(X, Y, Z\)</span>.
Each friend has two issues to resolve: money, time. These are both logical variables themselves.
For example, the money issue for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be a logical variable <span class="math inline">\(XM\)</span> and it is <span class="math inline">\({\tt TRUE}\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has enough money.
Similarly, the time issue is a logical variable <span class="math inline">\(XT\)</span> that is <span class="math inline">\({\tt TRUE}\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has enough vacation time.</p>
<p>So you might have R code that looks like this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r watch-out"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>XM &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>; XT &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">FALSE</span>; YM &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>; YT &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>; ZM &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">FALSE</span>; ZT &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">FALSE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In thi particular assignment of <span class="math inline">\({\tt TRUE}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\tt FALSE}\)</span> to the variables, it is the case that only <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> does not have enough money. There are many other asignments that are possible. For instance, it might be the case as follows</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r watch-out"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>XM &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>; XT &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>; YM &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>; YT &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>; ZM &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>; ZT &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="ot">TRUE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>I would like you to write a logical expression in R code that evaluates to <span class="math inline">\({\tt TRUE}\)</span> (they will go on vacation) or <span class="math inline">\({\tt FALSE}\)</span> (they will not go on vacation) for each of the condition below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><em>The condition is that all three people have enough money and enough time.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The condition is that all three people have enough money but time does not matter.</em> (Maybe they decide to go for a weekend instead of two weeks.)</p></li>
<li><p><em>The condition is that all three people have enough time but at least one person must have enough money.</em> (The rich one will pay for the other two.)</p></li>
<li><p><em>The condition is that all three people have enough time but at least two people must have enough money.</em>
```</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck!</p>
