<p>A homework assignment will be due approximately every three weeks.</p>
<p>Generally, each assignment covers material we recently covered in class.</p>
<p>They are designed so that you can explore concepts and tools in more depth.</p>
<h3 id="seeking-assistance">Seeking assistance</h3>
<p>You should complete the assignments alone, however it is perfectly ok to ask for help. This order is the best for asking for assistance:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Start by seeking assistance from sites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>. Almost every question you can ask has already been answered there.<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The benefit of this approach is that you learn to communicate your issues with other people, and learn to navigate the very considerable amount of web-based informtion available.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>Ask the question in a clear manner in a general <i class="fa fa-slack" aria-hidden="true"></i> <span class="math inline">\({\tt Slack}\)</span> channels (<span class="math inline">\({\tt \#biol480}\)</span>).<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This allows other students in the class to practice answering questions. This is where students can earn <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>s for the quality of their answers.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>If the question can’t be answered by other students on <span class="math inline">\({\tt Slack}\)</span>, either the TA or I can assist via <span class="math inline">\({\tt Slack}\)</span>.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Note that by always asking questions within <span class="math inline">\({\tt Slack}\)</span>, we have a persistent record of our conversation and the solution.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>As a very last resort, diret message via <span class="math inline">\({\tt Slack}\)</span> technical questions to the TA or instructor.<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">There are a lot of reasons to avoid DMing us. For example, if we answer a question in a DM, we have to re-answer the next time a student asks the same questions. However, if we answer it in a class-wide channel on <span class="math inline">\({\tt Slack}\)</span>, all students benefit and we only have to write out the answer once.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>We understand that many people are self-conscience when asking questions, and would therefore try to avoid public <span class="math inline">\({\tt Slack}\)</span> channels. Although there are ways on <span class="math inline">\({\tt Slack}\)</span> to ask a question anonymously (and you are welcome to use them), we would prefer that you build towards a pyschology that <strong><em>there are no stupid questions</em></strong>. Learning to communicate with your peers is an important part of your studies.</p>
<p>Remember that you can ask questions during
<strong><em>labs</em></strong>, <strong><em>TA office hours</em></strong>, <strong><em>instructor office hours</em></strong> and <strong><em>during the lectures</em></strong> (time permitted).</p>
<h3 id="submitting-assignments">Submitting assignments</h3>
<p>Assignment submission is always electronic and via <i class="fa fa-google"></i> <span class="math inline">\({\tt Google Drive}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Make sure you have your gmail account and have set the permissions appropriately on google+. Please ensure that it is straightforward for us to associate the name of your gmail account with your real name.<span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">If the username of your gmail account is e.g. “kingofeverything”, it might be hard for us to guess who this, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Go to <span class="math inline">\({\tt Google Drive}\)</span> and create a folder using your last name as the title.</p>
<p>In this folder, you create a series of subfolders Assignment 1, Assignment 2, Assignment 3, Assignment 4. All files for a particular assignment belong in the associated folder.</p>
<p>After you have put all your files into this directory for the assignment
(precise formats etc. will be specified in each assignment),
share this folder with</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\({\bf {\tt biol480.concordia@gmail.com}}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you share the folder, there is a box that allows you to add a comment. Make sure to add this comment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>BIOL480, Assignment #, Concordia ID, Lastname, Firstname</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="late-assignments">Late assignments</h3>
<p>Marginally late work (defined as less than 2 days past the deadline) can be ok, although you are warned that this is usually not the case near mid-terms or end of term<span><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is because it delays us releasing answer keys. Please respect that the TA is working on a tight timeline and any exceptions you ask for blowback of them.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Late late work (defined as more than 2 days) requires special permission from the instructor.<span><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Generally, it is not a problem if it only happens once, the student is proactive in clarifying the situation with the instructor, and it does not hinder us releasing answer keys before midterms and exams.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
