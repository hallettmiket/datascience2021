# Points of reflection

- Your devices contain an incredible amount of personal information. The consequences from misuse by malicious 
individuals for some of this information are quite easy to see (eg credit card numbers). How else can data be
stolen from your machine and used in a malcious fashion?

- What are some of the potential negative aspects of cloud approaches in terms of security and privacy? What mechanisms exist to stop or at least make difficult misuse of your data?
