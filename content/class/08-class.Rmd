## Points of Reflection

- What advantages are there for data scientists if there is a single data structure like the ${\tt tibble}$?

- Do a bit of archaelogy and figure out what this ancient ${\tt data.frame}$ is.

- Would science be better served if there were more standardized ways of making data and metadata available? (I'm considering Sunagawa et al's approach here.)

- What is an OTU? What is a 97% OTU?

- What is a prokaryote?

- What are the filter sizes used by Tara Oceans?

- Why is filtering important?
