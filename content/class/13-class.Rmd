# Action Items

- Oct 29 Midterm

- Work your way through  the ${\tt my\_scan}$ function. Trace through the execution of the algorithm using the ARR1 binding site and a short sequence three base pairs longer than it.

## Points of Reflection

- Our model is very simple. Name some of aspects of DNA-protein interactions that are not captured by our model.

- What other aspects of gene regulation are not well modelled by our approach?

- How could we improve our mdoel to better reflect the bioogical reality of transcription factors, binding sites and gene regulation in general?
