## Points of Reflection

- Our model is very simple. Name some of aspects of DNA-protein interactions that are not captured by our model.

- What other aspects of gene regulation are not well modelled by our approach?

- How could we improve our mdoel to better reflect the bioogical reality of transcription factors, binding sites and gene regulation in general?
