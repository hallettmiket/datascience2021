# Action Items

- Assignment 4


# Points of Reflection

- Try to understand the long branch attraction problem.

- Enumerate all the undirected graphs with 6 species.

- Suppose you have an amino acid sequence of length 100. You apply the PAM_1 Markov model to each position. So some amino acids change, likely most don't. We would expected 1% to change. Now apply the PAM_1 MM again. Do you expected to see that 2% of the amino acids have changed? Why or why not?

- Why is PAM_250 considered the upper bound? What happens after PAM_250?
