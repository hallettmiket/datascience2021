# Slides

- [View lectures slide in your browser (html)](/slides/19-slides.html)



# Action Items

- Assignment 4

- Plase read [R for Data Science, Chapter 23](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html). It will provide more background and supporting concepts for the supervised analysis that comes next.



# Points of Reflection

- How did we know k in the k-means algorithm? Or did we?

- How well do our $5$ subtypes line up with the $5$ subtypes from Parker et al.?

- With respect to the breast cancer dataset, what happens when you change the number of clusters to $3$,$4$, or $10$ for example? What happens? And how does it compare again Parker et al.?

- Please read Chapter 23
