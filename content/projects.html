There is a small project that is worth <span class="math inline">\(10\%\)</span> of the overall grade. It
should be the equalivalent work as an assignment.</p>
<h3 id="project-outline">Project Outline</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>You can work in groups, but the larger the group, the more that is expected.<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">For those team members that go above and beyond, remember the <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> mechanism!<br />
<br />
</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>By mid-semester (<a href="/syllabus/">date</a>), you or your group should submit to the instructor by Slack a one page outline of your proposal.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Pick a topic close to your research heart. Perhaps the resulting tool could actually be useful to you and your research down the road.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>The projects can be submitted at the end of term; they will be displayed for prosperity on on this website.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">With students’ permissions of course.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>A mixture of media can be used including text documents (eg Google Docs), images (eg Google Drawings), R Markdown, or R Notebooks. Code should be able to be executed by the instructor, and the results should be as reproducible as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>A small manual or guide to your project should be submitted.<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><strong><em>Have fun with it!</em></strong><br />

<p>Many people ask why <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span> and not <span class="math inline">\({\tt Python}\)</span>, a programming language often used in bioinformatics and elsewhere. There is no simple answer to this. Both have their strengths and a good Biodata Scientist will learn both. The goal of the project could be to learn the basics of <span class="math inline">\({\tt Python}\)</span> You would be expected to show proficiency in the language to approximately the same level in the course for <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span>. You can be creative and choose to visualize complicated biological data or, for example, re-do questions from the assignment in <span class="math inline">\({\tt Python}\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="idea-2.-bio-data-science-in-julia">Idea 2. Bio-Data Science in Julia</h3>
<p>Julia is relatively new language that is increasingly used in bioinformatics. Many people think this is going to be a very important and ubquitious language. The goal of the project could be to learn the basics of <span class="math inline">\({\tt Julia}\)</span>. You would be expected to show proficiency in the language to approximately the same level in the course for <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span>. You can be creative and choose to visualize complicated biological data or, for example, re-do questions from the assignment in <span class="math inline">\({\tt Julia}\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="idea-3.-web-development-via-rstudios-blogdown">Idea 3. Web-development via RStudio’s blogdown</h3>
<p>This entire course was developed in RStudio’s <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2018/create-and-maintain-websites-with-r-markdown-and-blogdown/">blogdown</a>. This includes the course website and the course lecture slides. blogdown uses the R markdown language for making fancy text. The goal of this project could be to develop using this system a personal academic web page for yourself or your lab.</p>
<h3 id="idea-4.-interactive-visualization-for-a-biological-dataset">Idea 4. Interactive visualization for a biological dataset</h3>
<p>The goal of the project is to explore visualization in R using <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>, produced by RStudio. Shiny allows users to quickly produce and publish interactive visualizations. Here the project might involve developing a Shiny app for a particular dataset that you are interested in<span><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I can also make recommendations for publicly accesible datasets.<br />
<br />
</span></span>. Although you are welcome to develop a Shiny tool from scratch, it might be easier to start wth an example from the Shiny Gallery.</p>
<h3 id="idea-5.-deep-learning-in-biology.">Idea 5. Deep learning in biology.</h3>
<p>Develop a deep neural network for a problem related to biology. This can be done using one of several packages for deep learning in <span class="math inline">\({\tt R}\)</span>. For example, you can use <a href="https://keras.rstudio.com/">KERAS</a> in R<span><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">There are other options besides KERAS. So if you have an interest in a different deep learning package, go for it!<br />
<br />
</span></span>. There are nice tutorials <a href="https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/getting_started.html">online</a>. Maybe … maybe… I will allow you to use my lab’s GPU cluster but start with your RStudio Cloud. I can help you find an appropriate biological dataset and/or assist you with defining a good learning question.<span><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">

<h3 id="idea-6.-develop-a-new-tool-for-a-problem-arising-in-biology">Idea 6. Develop a new tool for a problem arising in biology</h3>
<p>Perhaps you already have some computational challenges w.r.t. your own research project. You are welcome to use this as the basis of your project. Here you would just define one such problem and show how tools from bioinformatics, computational biology or data science can be used to address the problem. Microscopy has many interesting challenges and I can help you get started.</p>
<h3 id="idea-7.-dashboards-for-your-research-project">Idea 7. Dashboards for your research project</h3>
<p><a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/dashboards.html">Dashboards</a> are really nice tools for bringing together different interactive visualizations and data analyses. A very popular one currently in <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">John Hopkin’s Coronavirus Resource Centre</a>. These are often built with Shiny.</p>
