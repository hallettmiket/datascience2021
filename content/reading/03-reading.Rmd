# Required

- [Chapter 3 R for Data Science: Introduction](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)

- [Sequencing by Synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZeN-IgjYCo)

- [Sequencing by Synthesis (more background including DNA chemistry)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI0Fo9kaWqo)

# Recommended

- [Transcriptomics](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0n2tSKAVc2chal9Wt8cj-uDiQ#Lecture01%5FRNAseqIntro) Excellent set of slides describing sequencing technologies and trends. Includes nice grpahics about Illumina technology. [From D Beiting, UPenn]

# Deeper insight

- [DIY Transcriptomics](http://diytranscriptomics.com/) A nice course covering the central topics of transcriptomic bioinformatic analysis.
- [RNA-seqlopedia](https://rnaseq.uoregon.edu/) A great resource for all things related to RNA-seq.

# Action items  

- You might investigate the small dataset in Project TCGA-BRCA at RStudio Cloud. We will discuss this at length in the lecture.
