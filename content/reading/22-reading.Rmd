# Points of Reflection 

- How can Simpson's paradoxes be resolved with single cell sequencing?

- What are the reasons that isogenic cells vary from individual to individual? in mammalian tissue? in bacteria or fungal populations?

- In your area of interest, how could single cell technologies and analytics assist in our understanding of important biologies?
