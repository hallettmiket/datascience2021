      <description>This is the first class, so allow me to run through how the Readings pages work.
Both Readings and Video should be completed before the actual lecture. The lecture itself is intended for you to ask questions, for me to give out small quizzes/puzzles/questions (for grades), and for me to provide deeper insight into the material.
Required  Please read the Overview for the course.Required reading represents fundamental material that you are expected to master.</description>

A homework assignment will be due approximately every three weeks.
Generally, each assignment covers material we recently covered in class.
They are designed so that you can explore concepts and tools in more depth.
Seeking assistance You should complete the assignments alone, however it is perfectly ok to ask for help.</description>

      <description>Question 1.
I think that lecture 01 sufficiently covers the different concepts and you received significant marks if you acknowledged some of the central issues discussed there.
I did remove marks if there wasn’t care taken to discuss security and address the fact that Cloud solutions are likely not possible with clinical samples (unless extreme care is given either through cryptography or through special types of cloud computing). This aspect of the question builds on Question 1 of assignment 1 that asked you to investigate what rights Google reserves when data is stored on their server.</description>
