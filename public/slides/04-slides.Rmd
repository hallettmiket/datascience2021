## Outline for today

- Our goal is to cover some very fundamental concepts underlying how data is represented and
manipulated in R. 
- Lecture 04 will be carried out directly in RStudio Cloud.
- This suites the material and also gives me a chance to show you some tricks with RStudio.
- The code and data I use today in in the ${\tt examples}$ and ${\tt data}$ folders in RStudio project L04.
- We don't cover all the basics of programming here. Just a few key concepts.

# Action Items

- Solve the swap problem discussed in the lecture.
   

## Points of Reflection

- Why do you think the notion of data has a specific class is important?
- You have __operators__ $(+, -, *, /)$ and __operands__, the objects that the operators are applied to; eg in the equation $x + y$, $x$ and $y$ are operands.
- Does every operator work on every class of data? 
- Notice that we used the $+$ operator when building the layers of the ${\tt ggplot}$ objects.
- What are the operands here and what class do they have?
