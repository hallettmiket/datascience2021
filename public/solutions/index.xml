      <description>Question 1.
I think that lecture 01 sufficiently covers the different concepts and you received significant marks if you acknowledged some of the central issues discussed there.
I did remove marks if there wasnâ€™t care taken to discuss security and address the fact that Cloud solutions are likely not possible with clinical samples (unless extreme care is given either through cryptography or through special types of cloud computing). This aspect of the question builds on Question 1 of assignment 1 that asked you to investigate what rights Google reserves when data is stored on their server.</description>
